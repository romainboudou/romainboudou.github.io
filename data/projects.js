I had to respect a specific charter based on colors, style and models. I started by making the models on Figma, then the code was done in HTML/CSS with some animations and functionalities in JavaScript. It needed 4 pages, a home page, an “about” page, a page for creations and a page to place orders. The most interesting page is the order page, because I used PHPMailer to create an email sending system to place an order. I also had to manage the security of the site to avoid any abuse by email.</p>",
