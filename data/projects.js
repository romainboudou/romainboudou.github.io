        description: "The Nine Winds is the debut of an atmospheric Metroidvania game steeped in ancient Aztec mythology, developed in just one week.",
        detailedDescription: "<p><strong>The Nine Winds</strong> is my response to a 3rd year project on Unity. This is the first game that I developed alone. It's the beginning of Metroidvania in which we play an avatar of an Aztec God who must find 9 spheres in order to restore balance. The game is intended to be labyrinthine where we must retrace our steps to advance in the game. A sphere gives us a skill which will therefore allow us to move forward. Some voice lines are available for a bit of LoRe of the game.</p> <p><h4>Skills worked:</h4> <ul><li>Game design of a complete game</li><li>Level design of a map for MetroidVania</li> <li>Added animations</li> <li>Creation of user interfaces</li> <li>Use of voice lines and music to give an atmosphere to the game</li> <li>Unique designs made by me</li></ul></p>",

        detailedDescription: "<p><strong>Age of Guild</strong> is my response to a 3-month end-of-year project on Unity. In a group of 4 we had to develop an \"Age of War\" game with freedom on the assets used. The goal of the game is to destroy the enemy base by sending different types of troops, placing turrets, improving the statistics of our troops/turrets and activating skills. There are 7 Ages that we can cross which will have the effect of improving our troops that we send. The game is available in 4 languages, English, French, Spanish and German. Options are also available to change the volume of sound effects and music. </p> <p><h4>Skills worked:</h4> <ul><li>Reproduction of an existing game with new features</li><li>Creation of user interfaces</li> <li>Added animations</li> <li>Use of languages, sound and musi</li> <li>Unique designs outside of the Background</li><li>Teamwork</li><li>Unique designs made by me</li></ul></p>",
